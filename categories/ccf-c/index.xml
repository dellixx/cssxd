 ABSTRACT While the Transformer architecture has been widely used in natural language processing tasks and computer vision tasks, its application in medical visual question answering is still limited. Most current methods rely on an image extractor to obtain visual features and a text extractor to capture semantic features, and then a fusion module to merge the information from the two modalities to predict the final result.</description>

 ABSTRACT Knowledge graph embedding aims to learn representations of entities and relations in a knowledge graph. Recently, QuatE has introduced the graph embeddings into the quaternion space. However, there are still challenges in dealing with complex patterns, including 1-N, N-1, and multiple-relations between two entities. Since the learned entity embeddings tend to overlap with each other in the first two cases, and the learned relation embeddings tend to overlap with each other in the last case.</description>
